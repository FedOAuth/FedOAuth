Federated Open Authentication (FedOAuth)
========================================
FedOAuth is a provider for federated authentication mechanisms with a modular authentication backend.

Currently implemented are:
- OpenID
- Persona / BrowserID


Setup
-----
To setup a local hack instance, just copy fedoauth.cfg.sample to fedoauth.cfg run "python setup.py develop" and execute ./runserver.

If it does not give any errors, your FedOAuth instance is now running on http://localhost:5000/.

Please note that Persona will not work if your server is not internet-accessible or available over SSL.


OpenID
------
The OpenID provider will work out of the box after configuration.


Persona
-------
To get the Persona provider working, you need to generate a 2048-bit RSA key.
To do this, execute: openssl genrsa -des3 -out persona.key 2048 .

After this, configure the filename and passphrase to this key.

Please note that for this to work, you need to serve FedOAuth on the core of a domain with SSL.

If you host FedOAuth on id.example.com, you can get username@example.com to verify by putting a file with the following contents in the .well-known/browserid path for example.com:

{ "authority": "id.example.com" }

Please note that this file must be served over HTTPS.
